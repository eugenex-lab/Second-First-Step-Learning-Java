Java JDK 11(long term support) , Amzaon something something

Versions of JDK --- LTS
JVM -
JDK -its create a java program .. its different in win, linux and mc ... itd has testing and debugger
and compiler for compiling .. t houses the jre <not the case b4>
JRE -Java Rutime envirment --->     Its used to run , it has libraries, and java lauhcer and VM
 u cant crete codes here...

 Jdk create clss file, via the JRE in the JVM --> so wen u cove codes it runs via the JRE on thers JVM
 it takes teh code use the JRE Of that machine and create a JVM

 NOte -- Java is slow cos of this,  Java program works on JV
 C++ runs faster cos its not working on a Jv.. so the app is executed on a particualr machine it works on
 the Virtual machine slowness is a non issue... so a game is the point the noice shows

How C++ works --> it runs on the hardware ---its specific , its compilers her programs
